# Insight about the project:

build an 8-Puzzle solver based on fourth different types of AI algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS),  Iterative Deeping Search (IDS), and A* search algorithms.

In the first part, it is required to create a data representation method to store the data while finding the goal state of the puzzle, such as stack, tree, or queue. 

In the second part, it is required to create a graphic user interface to facilitate the procedures of controlling the steps of the solution. Also, to represent and obtain the effects of using each algorithm in terms of memory usage, elapsed Time to find the solution, movements number to reach goal state, and the number of the nodes used to store the data. 

In the third part, it is required to implement the abovementioned algorithms on the initial state of 346, 108, 725 and observe the differences and results of memory usage and time consumption.

In the last part, it is required to implement the Monte-Carlo simulation by conducting a comprehensive simulation on many intimal states predetermined by the user to observe the disadvantage and advantages of each algorithm.
